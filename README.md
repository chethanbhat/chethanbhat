# Chethan Bhat | Senior Software Engineer

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a seasoned Senior Software Engineer with expertise in both front-end and back-end development. My focus lies primarily on front-end technologies, where I have achieved significant accomplishments.

I am currently working as a Founding Software Engineer at Adaptive Automation Technologies Inc., I have spearheaded the creation of a React-powered front-end for an Access Management and Security Compliance product. This involved leveraging my strong skills in React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS to build a robust and user-friendly interface.  Additionally, I have utilized the NextJS framework to develop the marketing website for the organization, ensuring an optimized and seamless user experience.

Throughout my career, I have consistently delivered outstanding results. In my previous role, I successfully delivered over several high-quality landing pages and websites for clients. By skillfully translating wireframes into functional user interfaces, I brought designs to life using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Furthermore, I seamlessly integrated APIs, analytics, and marketing tools to enhance the websites' functionality and performance.

While my specialization is in front-end development, I possess strong skills in backend technologies as well. I have experience building APIs using NodeJS with Express, GoLang,  and I am proficient in working with databases such as Postgres, MySQL, and MongoDB. This versatility allows me to effectively collaborate with full stack teams and contribute to both front-end and back-end development processes.

With a passion for clean code and exceptional user experiences, I am committed to staying updated with the latest industry trends and continuously improving my skills. I thrive in fast-paced environments, and my ability to apply advanced design patterns, well-structured components, and TypeScript to revamp legacy code has been instrumental in enhancing design and performance.

I am always seeking new challenges and opportunities to apply my diverse technical skill set. Whether it's creating intuitive front-end interfaces or developing robust back-end solutions, I am dedicated to delivering high-quality results that meet user needs and drive business success.
